# The different sources will be merged. For further information,

# Apart from the various source files, there are two independent source trees
# for user-specific configuration.
# Generally tool_git > tool_global.
# `tool_global` focuses on specific users, of which most values
# will be respected by all formulae in the `tool` suite:
tool_global:
  users:

      # The following is global configuration for the user named `user`.
    user:

        # Force the usage of XDG directories for this user.
      xdg: true

        # Sync this user's config from a dotfiles repo.
        # The available paths and their priority can be found in the
        # rendered `config/sync.sls` file (currently, @TODO docs).
        # Overview in descending priority:
        # salt://dotconfig/<minion_id>/<user>/git
